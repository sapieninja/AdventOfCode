# My Solutions for Advent of code 2020
### Things to note
* These were coded under time pressure so they may be (very) bad
* Some have been updated later by me to make them nicer.
* The commits from after finishing the challenge succesfully have the time I took as well 
as the time that timothy langer (my competition) took. 
* I am using the (excellent) AoCHelper library to help me organise, run and debug my code, all while keeping the file system fairly functional.
